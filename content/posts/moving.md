    "Really makes ya think, huh?"

Moving means relocating you, and everything you own from A to B. This week, i am moving, but i dont know where i will end up. I do not yet have another home to go to. I am terrified. I can physically feel the fear in my body. I feel it in my stomach.  The stressful fear is  enough to make my balls shrivel up. I fear they will climb back into my ass, where i assume they came from.

I know i will start studying in Copenhagen, but i do not have a place there yet. Sometimes questions like, "what if i never find a place" will start creeping into my frontal lobe of the brain. (Which by the way is my second favourite lobe, right after the ear-lobe).

These increasingly unnerving questions are somewhat necessary, because without them i will never get anything done. However, i often enjoy listening to these voices. I have befriended them. 

I was born amongst these voices, and have grown immune to them. These voices dont translate to action. Usually they just end up paralyzing me. I feel paralyzed by the mountain of tasks that i am facing. I feel like i am always stressed. This is the fourth year in a row where i have moved. Fuck this shit.


I have moved many times during my lifetime. This will technically be the third time i move across a country border. I'd like to think I'm pretty good at moving. However, i am constantly surprised by the amount of shit i have collected since last time i moved.
Moving is a mental exercise, because you have to actively think about what you value enough to bring with. Here are a few examples of annoying stuff i need to pass judgement upon:

* Small knick-knacks, that have exlusively sentimental value. ( My favourite knick-knack is probably a computer mouse with a small duck floating in it, from my roommates web store [duckmouse.no](https://duckmouse.no/). )

* Clothes that you really like, but dont really like. These are the clothes that have followed you for so long that it just feels wrong to get rid of them.

* Useful things, but they are easily replaced at another location. This is stuff like office supplies, [lamps](https://nuutti.no/posts/buttons/), or deodorants. If only i was an illiterate stinky man living in a dark room, i would not have to think about this bullshit.

* Books. These things suck balls. They are heavy, easy to replace, and kind of mostly [unused](https://nuutti.no/posts/i-fell-asleep/). Who needs books when you have nuutti.no?

*It is difficult to know what you want to transfer to your new home*

&nbsp;

At all times, there are two competing discourses in my head.

&nbsp;

* **On one hand, I want to become immaterial:**

    Live in a barrel with no material possesions. Live the noble life of a nomad. A stoic man who chose to sign himself out of society.

&nbsp;

* **On the other hand,** i want to *fuuuuuuuuuuckkkkkk*

    I am merely an ape who learned how to talk: can you blame me? I want material pleasure even though i want freedom from it. I want to win against the world. I am constantly grappling between proving the whole world wrong, or following the path of less resistance.
