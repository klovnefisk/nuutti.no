    "Really makes ya think, huh?" (the first person to say this must've felt really cool)

Moving means relocating you, and everything you own from A to B. This week, i am moving, but i will not know where i will end up. I do not yet have another home to go to. This is a scary feeling indeed.

I know i will start studying in Copenhagen, but i do not have a place there yet. Sometimes questions like, "what if i never find a place" will start creeping into my frontal lobe of the brain. (Which by the way is my second favourite lobe, right after the ear-lobe).

These increasingly unnerving questions are somewhat necessary, because without them i will never get anything done. However, i often enjoy listening to these voices. I have befriended them. 


As Bane, from batman said:

**"You merely adopted the darkness, I WAS BORN IN IT."**

I was born amongst these voices, and have grown immune to them. These voices dont translate to action, usually they end up paralyzing me. I feel paralyzed by the mountain of tasks that i am facing. I feel like i am always stressed. This is the fourth year in a row where i have moved. Fuck this shit.


I have moved many times during my lifetime. This will technically be the third time i move across a country border. I'd like to think I'm pretty good at moving. However, i am constantly surprised by the amount of shit i have collected since last time i moved.
Moving is a mental exercise, because you have to actively think about what you value enough to bring with. Here are a few examples of annoying stuff i need to pass judgement upon:

* Small knick-knacks, that have sentimental value, but otherwise they are junk. (i have a golfball that my friend has written "secret inside" on.)

* Clothes that you really like, but dont really like. These are the clothes that have followed you for so long that it just feels wrong to get rid of them.

* Useful things, but they are easily replaced at another location. This is stuff like office supplies, lamps, or deodorants. It just feels wasteful to throw in the trash or give away if I'm going to buy another anyway?

* Books. These things suck balls. THey are heavy, easy to replace, and kind of, mostly unused.

*It is difficult to know what you want to transfer to your new home*

For me, home is where i live.
For some, 

It's a change of scenery but also a new chapter, whether you want it or not. Especially being..
