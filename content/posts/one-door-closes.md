They say *"when one door closes, another one opens."*

Sometimes you can mistake a door as open, when in reality it's just off it's hinges. Broken, crazy, OUT OF PLACE.

Maybe the door has just been repainted and you get wet paint on you.

Sometimes it feels as if my door is completely locked and I've lost the key somewhere, i fear that i will never be able to open.

But perhaps one day someone will forcibly help me open up by force. In some violent manner with a medieval battering ram or a crowbar maybe.

But for now, i think i will be focusing on unlocking my own door, before entertain any others.
