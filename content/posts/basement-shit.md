I go to the toilet in the basement of my campus in order to take a shit in peace.

It's what some would call

**"intentional living"**.

Taking choices in my everyday life that make my life feel like i have control of it.

Some order in my chaotic everyday life.

There are many restrooms on campus, but *i go out of my way* to walk to the basement. 

Sometimes this commute is a considerable detour from where i have class. 

But i do it because i want to *shit in silence.*

*I want to have a calming crap.*

#### I take pride in a *peaceful passage of poop.*

### I Sincererly want my Secrement to Slowly Slide out in a Satisfying Sense.

## My Bowel movements Broaden my Basshole.


&nbsp;

And this is why I am MIFFED TO DISCOVER that,

just as i sat down to release my load i can hear two guys LAUGHING and HOLLERING outside the stall.

SHUT UP.

Let me have my basement shit in peace.
