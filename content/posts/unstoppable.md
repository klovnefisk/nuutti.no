I recetly came across an interesting saying:

“If a man knows not which port he sails, no wind is favorable.”


In another similar, but different sense: without a destination, one cannot be stopped.

Therefore it seems the easy way to becoming unstoppable, is not having a goal. 

This is why setting goals feels scary.

As always there is a happy medium. If i can learn how to enjoy the journey, any detour will feel like an extension to something enjoyable.

I am lacking purpose, but I am not meaningless.
