**Maybe you're just a toothbrush, and maybe I'm just overthinking. But i've been meaning to tell you... I'm breaking up with you**

&nbsp;

# *Its not you. Its me.*

&nbsp;

Well, actually -

It's a 100% you. You're... **Old**... And frankly i don't know what i **ever saw in you.**

I've found NEW a brush with bristles that look *shiny*, and *straight.* 

Your bristles are all **fucked up and fuzzy.** You're not the brush i once picked at the store.

Honestly, I've never been able to look at you the same, ever since i **caught you brushing my roommate.**

This new brush comes in an eco friendly packaging. *No plastic.*

This brush is the *brush of my dreams.*

It has the *perfect curves,* its neither too slim or thick.

And i love touching the *soft silicone.*

Honestly: it *looks* and *feels* better than you.

My new brush reaches *places you've never reached*.

There have been many brushes before, but *this one is different,* i know it.

This brush is *special*. Its not a **cheap brush that somebody would buy while traveling.**

This is a *premium brush* that is able to switch heads when the time is right.

You were always stuck in **your ways**. You **never wanted to change**, even though i wanted us to *change together*. You're not produced with an interchangable head.

And that is why you're just **not a very good toothbrush** anymore. We tried different pastes, and i even tried flossing. Regardless, *I'm sorry i said you look fucked up and fuzzy*. I suppose I'm not as mature as i thought.

You're just **not** a brush that is meant **for long term brushing.**

**You gave me cavities.**

I *tried to forgive*, and even fix your bristles, but you are not made to be fixed. 

That's why im **throwing you in the trash.**

*I deserve better.*

&nbsp;

Goodbye toothbrush.
