*I am numb to sensory input.*

*The creaks from my bike are the only thing that confirms me of the fact that i am moving.*

*I am in fact moving, and the road seems to wobble as well.*

*In my backpack i have a wet taquito from 7 eleven.*

*I had to save the second one for later, because the first one was so spicy.*

*The warm, soft and tender texture of a taquito is almost a homo-erotic sensation.*

*The road ahead of me is wobbling some more. Oh wait, that could be me.*

*The street lights look blurry, and somehow their brightness blinds me. As i stop next to a red light, i need to squint.*

*This traffic light is way too bright.*

*I also almost got in a fight.*

*I shouldn't have had so many drinks tonight.*
