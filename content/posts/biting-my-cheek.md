The pain is excruciating. Please make this end.

I'm a 22 year old political science student, studying at NTNU, Trondheim in Norway.

It all started with a vegan spaghetti bolognese. One of my favourite meals to cook. It's easy, cheap, and tasty.

And let me tell you this: I was [starving](https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/). 

In my hurry gorge down on this magnificent meal, i made a major techical flaw in my eating technique. A blunder for the centuries, so to say.

I accidentally bit the innside of my cheek, at the very back of my mouth, on the left side.

In plain english one could say 

*that shit hurt like a motherfucker*

It has become exponentially worse as the days have gone by. Everytime i close my mouth i bite it. I don't know how to get rid of the swelling. Physically the pain is maybe a 7/10, not that bad, but mentally this has consumed me. 

Every meal, and every bite accelerates my heart beat.

The despair and terror are un-invited guests of my mind. 

But i literally HAVE TO EAT. This inevitably leads to me biting the cheek AGAIN.

Thats why I'm doing this AMA. I'm here to answer all your questions!

Feel free to ask me anything!

*Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!!!

*Edit: Wow, i was not expecting this many questions and advice from you guys! I will go to a lecture now but will come back to answer more questions later!

*Edit: Thanks again to everyone for being so nice! This was so much fun, thank you for yet another great AMA! I'm going to end the AMA here, i compiled the most common questions underneath here, for easier access in the future!

1. *Does spicy food hurt the open wound in your cheek?*

    YES. Holy shit. As someone who finds a mild chili flavour in their food pleasant, this whole situation has brought an involuntary spice change to my diet.

2. *have you tried eating exclusively soft foods, like soups and mashes?*

    This question really pisses me off. Imagine how you would feel if you were suggested to  eat only mashes and soups for an extended period of time? I'm a god damn grown man with teeth made for chewing. But yes, I'm keeping this as a last resort solution if this torturous pain does not pass by itself.

3. *Why don't you just eat very carefully?*

    .... You see... Since it really doesn't hurt unless I'm eating, I keep forgetting the situation until i am painfully reminded by feeling of intense pain shooting through my body.

4. *Has this whole shpiel ruined your relationship with vegan bolognese*

    NO! I will not blame the food, and neither should you!

5. *How is your oral hygiene affected by this traumatic event?*

    Good question! Brushing my teeth can be done, with minor tingling sensations caused by the fresh mint flavour in the toothpaste. Once however, i tried using mouthwash.

    I fell to my knees, while tears poured down my cheeks onto the [cold bathroom floor](https://nuutti.no/posts/a-day-in-my-life/). The pain was **harrowing**. I am NEVER doing that again.
