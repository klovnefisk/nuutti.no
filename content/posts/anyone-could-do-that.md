I feel compelled to justify my existence.

If i want to say something it ought to be good. It should be funny or important. It needs to be at least better than "something anyone could do."

However, a parodox emerges from this.

    I am anyone.

"anyone could do that"

And here is anyone doing it.

You get me?

I ought to do it better than anyone.

Who am I competing against?

Life.

Job.

Words. 

Sex.

Anyone could do those.

I wish i was anyone, so i could do that.

Still stuck on number one.
