Fuck you happy people.

I'm not particularily happy with the world, or with our culture.

I'm more optimistic than that.

I don't think the current status quo is inevitable, unchangeable or "the best we can do".

If i were to be happy with the world, i would be happy for all the suffering, and inequality it contains.

As Nietsche said so nicely: To say yes to one instant is to say yes to all of existence.

I know that we could structure our society in a different manner if we wanted to. In a more fair manner. So, why should i be happy with how things are looking?

I'm not particularily happy with myself either.

I used to be more miserable.

I used to think that i should try to be happy, but the moment i accepted my misery it disappeared.

If we accept the world how it is, the misery of it disappears.

Too many people are trying to fix their own life.

That shit is overrated.

Jordan Peterson is telling people to "clean your room before you change the world".

I think the state of my room is irrelevant to the world.

I used to be very unhappy with my experiences and our world, but now I've realised that searching for happiness is searching for a suitable coping mechanism to accepting the cruel world. 

Whenever i see someone who is happy i can look down at them, from my superior high horse of morals.

Yes, i can inflate my own sense of superiority: ALL HAPPY PEOPLE ARE DUMB.

But now I am stuck with slowly becoming happier because I've accepted this miserable life of self-importance and pretentiousness and now I'm slipping away from the very thing i took so much pride in.

And I'm going to keep blaming happy people for all my problems.

As my final point, my definition of happy is not smiling, or being contempt.

Because i smile a lot, i am contempt and i am grateful for what i have.

HAPPY people simply do stuff without thinking. That is happiness. Doing, consuming, travelling. Not thinking about the consequences of their actions.

That is happiness. To live life and do things without a worry in the world.

As the great Thunberg said: How dare you.
