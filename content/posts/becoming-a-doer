THATS IT.

I'm tired of being a stupid thinker living in my head i want to do stuff.

I think so much it's making me miserable!

I see people who do stuff and it makes me angry.

THATS DUMB!

I remember seeing someone playing the harry potter broom game on a grass field, AND IT PISSED ME OFF.

I think it's unfair that some people get to do that and feel happy.

CANT THEY SEE HOW STUPID THAT IS? THEY'RE NOT EVEN FLYING? THats arguably one of the main parts of it!

DONT THEY KNOW THAT QUIDDITCH IS A SHIT SPORT, EVEN IN THE HARRY POTTER UNIVERSE? (who decided that the inclusion of a small flying golden ball is a fair way to balance a sport??)
