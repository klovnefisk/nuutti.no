Commitment means saying yes for a future version of yourself.

And I am not that man!

For if i were, that would mean that the current version of myself is responsible for him. 

That in turn, would require me to completely change how i view myself and the world.

Who am I to make decisions for a Nuutti who i do not know yet?! I do not know what he wants!

When other people, such as my roommates do this, i fucking hate it.

I could invite them to a literal flying circus with Barack fucking Obama as a guest appearance and they would still be afraid of making a decision for their future self.

*"that sounds really fun, actually it sounds like the time of our life. Let me think about it"*

But who am I to complain. There's a myriad of things i am scared of committing to. It's becoming absurd at this point.

Bikes. I rent citybikes. What if i bike somwhere, but don't feel like biking back?

Pictures on the wall. Framed pictures require screws or nails. Nope! Thats too permanent. A POSTER with some mounting putty though, OH YEAH.

All fun, ZERO commitment.
