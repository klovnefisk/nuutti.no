### i am
human. i need no introduction.

### This
 is a blog. I made this website with some (a huge amount of) help from my roommate Isak.

If the website is poorly made, it is simply because i do not know how to program a website at all. Consider this a practical example of a [monkey on a typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) 

The words written here, hatch from my under-developed frontal lobe.

# the
#### design
on this website, is made to speak to the primitive parts of our human consciousness.
    It challenges the status quo of sleek modernity in web design, with bold, unnatural digital patterns, that contrast with colours found in nature.
