# Snapchat is a litmus test social media

In Norway,
when i meet people who don't use it, they are either too old or too cool for me.

*"I'd much rather just send a text or call you"*

*"You still use snapchat??"*

In the rest of Europe,
everyone just universally agrees on using whatsapp.

My own mother doesn't pick up the phone unless i call her on Whatsapp.

A few weeks ago, she had her birthday, i called her **2 days late**. She was *still* hung over.


### back to the topic at hand

Snapchat usernames can tell a lot about a person.

Until very recently, there was no way of changing names on there.
This lead to everyone being stuck with a username they made when they were 14.

People would add you with legendary names like

ultimate.Benjamin1

cutekittenKristine99

CrackbongWeedsm0ker69

Nowadays people just have their normal names! **shakes fist at the sky**

*I* on the other hand, have ***never*** *changed my name on snapchat*


I joined snapchat november 15th, 2012.

People were concerned about the world ending.

My dumb ass was downloading fucking snapchat.

I vividly remember snapchat asking me what my name was, so i typed nuutti.

And just like that, I made the most legendary move, of getting the username nuutti on snapchat.

no numbers, no animals, no nonsense. Pure fucking slickness.

6 letters of straight finnish dominance.

So yeah, of course I am sad that usernames can be changed now.

Yesterday someone sent me a message on snapchat. A photographer. He wanted to buy my snapchat username.

&nbsp;

I said

*"get fucked"*

&nbsp;

This name. This power. *It corrupts me.*

And i will gladly inflate my snapchat username ego any chance i get.

But the times are changing.

So the next time you see me, ask me for my number ;)
