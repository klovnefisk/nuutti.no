Before any of us have seen what they have to offer, i exclaim</p><p><em>&ldquo;RAPHAÃ‹L! I will have whatever you&rsquo;re having.&rdquo;.</em></p><p>His response may be something like</p><p><em>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know what <strong>I</strong> am getting&rdquo;</em></p><p>With an existentialist smirk i respond:</p><p><em>&ldquo;Exactly my point Raph!&rdquo;</em></p><p>Â </p><p>Other times i will simply pick the pizza with the funniest name.</p><p>Or perhaps i just pick the first thing that i see when i open the menu, as if it were one of those old facebook posts with the caption</p><pre><code>&quot;What words did you find ?!?!?&quot;.
</code></pre><p><img src=/images/ord.png alt=ord>
The first words i would find would always be something terrible like</p><p>Comfort</p><p>Confidence</p><p>Beauty</p><p>Those are the most capitalistic desires one can have xd.</p><p>Comfort is relative and beauty is subjective.
Confidence is arguably not even a positive trait unless it comes paired with some sort of happiness.</p><p>Â </p><p>Â </p><p>Dostoyevsky wrote in &ldquo;notes from the underground&rdquo; about freedom, reason and desire.</p><p>The storytelling character writes about how one could react if science were to reach a point where it can fully predict everything we are going to do.</p><p>The character argues that our <em>right to</em> desire things that are unreasonable and foolish for ourselves, is the very essence of our personality and individuality.</p><p>As Dostoyevsky put it -
If it were so that people are pianokeys being played by the laws of nature, would we not want to stand our ground and do the opposite on purpose?</p><p>What should we then do? What are the implications?</p><p>For me, this means i will not read any of the ingredients of what I&rsquo;m ordering.</p><p>This also means that sometimes i will call my friends and ask what i should make for dinner.</p><p><em><strong>I am preserving my unreasonableness.</strong></em></p><p>I refuse to become a bourgeoisie &ldquo;homo economicus&rdquo; who only acts upon reason and best practise. I don&rsquo;t want to do something, merely because i <em>should</em>.</p><p>I want to do things inefficiently, i want to actively &ldquo;choose&rdquo; un-enjoyable things.</p><p>For I am not a piano-key.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to partake in becoming the &ldquo;invisible hand of the free marketplace&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>I want to make stupid investments</strong> and spend my money unreasonably.</p><p>Perhaps i will donate too much money and spend the rest on something that kills me like cigarettes.</p><p>Then again, cigarettes are a multi million (probably billion) dollar industry, and by becoming addicted to them i am playing right into the capitalist hand! What can i do? Distressing indeed!</p><p><em>May this wicked world be cursed with illness and torment!</em></p><p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> a reasonable man!</p><p>And this, quite ironically seems like the most reasonable approach to me.</p><p>For me, being stupid and unreasonable seems completely reasonable.</p><p>I am not even sure if <em>people</em> are able to change their mind on anything.</p><p>And in this spesific example, I am <em>&ldquo;people&rdquo;.</em></p><p>-Stay stupid. Stay foolish.</p></div></main></body></html>
