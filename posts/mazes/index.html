Never knowing what comes behind the next turn.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve never been on these outskirts of Copenhagen before.</p><p>For once, i was outside before everyone else.</p><p>I am underdressed.</p><p>When i left my home yesterday, i wasn&rsquo;t expecting to sleep somewhere else.</p><p>The morning fog looks epic, but the moisture in the air makes for an annoying conductor of low temperatures.</p><p>Before i sat down, i tried to dry my bike seat, but since the bike leather is damaged, i basically sat on a wet sponge soaked in freezing water.</p><p>None of my clothes are windproof, and I have a long bikeride in front of me.</p><p>These new landscapes make me appreciate new things. Around every turn there is something I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Buildings, people, graffitis, bike lanes, restaurants and advertisements.</p><p>At one point i even biked through a ZOO??!?</p><p>I don&rsquo;t trust my eyes in the morning when they haven&rsquo;t even opened properly.</p><p>Thats why it was hard to believe these orbs inside my skull when they saw something that resembles a maze.</p><p>I saw a labyrinth made out of bushes, with leaves coloured into a beautiful orange shade by autumn.</p><p>Equipped with a banana and a smoothie i entered the labyrinth.</p><p>At first glance, the <a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/fences/>bush-fence</a> that makes up this labyrinth was waist high, but it became deeper and deeper, and all of a sudden i was surronded by 3meter tall bushes.</p><p>It was small, but i enjoyed it. I probably spent a good 15 minutes getting to the middle and back out.</p><p>Every turn in a maze is like gambling. Dead end, or further crossroads? Its truly a thrill.</p><p>The worst maze in the world is found in the stores called &ldquo;Normal&rdquo;.</p><p>First of all the walls arent high enough to make it exciting.</p><p>Second of all there is no dead ends, its just one long corridor with twists and turns that force you to look at every product and their cheap prices.</p><p>The true challenge of this labyrinth is not falling for the human urge to collect different objects for a good price.</p><p>It combines everything i hate about airport security lines and capitalism in one neat little neon coloured plastic vibe.</p><p>I think an approriate solution to this could be those vision blocking flaps that racing horses use.</p><p>Keep getting lost :3</p></div></main></body></html>
