What if i one day stop being funny?</p><p>I think this is the reason why I often don&rsquo;t like being funny on dates.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want partners to like me because I am funny.</p><p>For me, funnyness is fleeting.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s exactly why i was scared of being with you. It felt suspiciously unconditional.</p><p>What would i do if you one day wanted to let me go? This fear lead me to the conclusion that i should let you go before you could hurt me.</p><p>I realised that I&rsquo;ve ended a lot of my relationships because i don&rsquo;t respect people who like me: after all, I&rsquo;m a stupid horrible idiot. If you like me, you must be even worse!</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m done with this self hatred!</strong></p><p>I want to love myself like you said i should.</p><p>Many people have told me i am not horrible but i only believe you.</p><p><em>I liked you so much that it made me like everyone else more.</em></p><p>So if i can learn to like everyone else, i should learn how to like myself.</p><p>After all, who am i to think that i am somehow <em>more terrible</em> than anyone else? What kind of inflated sense of importance have i been having? I&rsquo;m not special! <strong>I&rsquo;m probably just as bad as everyone else!</strong> I should act accordingly.</p><p>Although i remember all my painful mistakes and stupid ideas, i need to forgive myself.</p><p>I want to love safely, knowing that the next relationship isn&rsquo;t dangling me above a pit of lonely depression.</p><p>I need to stop finding the meaning of life in women.</p><p>Maybe if i can learn to like myself, it will feel like wearing a parachute on the airplane of love.</p><p><strong>BOARDING GROUP B PLEASE COME TO GATE.</strong></p><p>Oh you bet I&rsquo;m going on, but only if I&rsquo;m ready.</p><p>And when I&rsquo;m boarding that plane, i will do it with a <em>luggage full of love.</em></p><p>Tax free.</p></div></main></body></html>
