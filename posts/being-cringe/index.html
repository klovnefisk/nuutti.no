I don&rsquo;t know if its&rsquo;s something that will disappear as i further develop my creative skillset.</p><p>Although many people think creative work is a skill - I don&rsquo;t.</p><p>In the search of becoming funnier, smarter and better at writing I&rsquo;ve been forced to dissect the frog of creativity, and I don&rsquo;t like it!</p><p>THe famous saying by E.B. White</p><pre><code>&quot;Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog. You understand it better but the frog dies in the process&quot;.
</code></pre><p>This pursuit has ruined my joy for creative things.</p><p>The joy was the only reason i started.</p><p>But now I search for reasons to why some creative work is good, and why some is bad.</p><p>In creative endeveours, it feels wrong to search for some objective measure of goodness.</p><p>Anyone could probably make a good piece of art. A song or maybe a joke. Someone could make recipes for humour, certain words and write a bible of what makes something rationally funny, by simply gathering enough data.</p><p>(let the record show, i don&rsquo;t know if i think standup is art)</p><p>Modern discourse on art is especially bad at this. It often revolves around pushing western standards of quality - such as rationalism and objectivity.</p><p>This is why i hate art critics. But I am forced to be one myself.</p><p>It feels like being an A.I. that can detect what people like without the joy.</p><p><a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/free-will/>As previously mentioned on this blog,</a> i want to avoid rational choices.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to write like the old white guys who wrote all the classics.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to make jokes like the old rich guys before me.</p><p>I want to do something new, so I am forced to be cringe.</p><p>The very essence of cringe itself is actually quite spectacular. There is very few feelings like it.</p><p>Watching someone be cringe, or being it yourself, its very gut wrenching and horrible.</p><p>It&rsquo;s more viceral and physical than many other emotions.</p><p>And yet i keep being cringe.</p><p>I guess I&rsquo;ve become the sisyphus of cringe.</p><p>Look at me.</p><p>I am cringe.</p></div></main></body></html>
