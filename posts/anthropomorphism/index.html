The most boring way to explain it is as a &ldquo;literary device&rdquo; where we transfer human qualities to non human entities such as animals, gods, or nature phenomena.</p><p>First of all, i hate that we call conceptual ideas &ldquo;literary devices&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s literally making something thats about ideas and transfer of consciousness into a fucking gadget. &ldquo;device&rdquo;. Lol. A fucking vibrator is a device. A god damn milkshake machine is a device. Anthropomorphism is a psychological part of the human experience that attempts to understand the world around us. HOW IS THIS ALSO A DEVICE.</p><p>At this point, what is NOT a linguistic device?? If i say &ldquo;hello neighbour&rdquo;. It could be a fucking literary device: <em>&ldquo;HELLO, is a literary device used to greet other beings, humans or even gods&rdquo;.</em></p><p>Anyway, anthropomorphism is basically us looking at a gorilla thats smiling, and thinking that it&rsquo;s happy, when in reality gorillas show their teeth to threaten you.</p><p>Or in dog training people are often taught that DOGS DO NOT THINK LIKE HUMANS. And even though they often feel like small children, we cannot train them using human psychology.</p><p>So we are often warned of anthropomorphizing animals too much, as it can lead to misunderstandings. But here we get to my recent revelation:</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been anthropomorphizing people.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been assuming people think like me, and placing my values and therefore judgement on other people.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve assumed that people have similar motives to me.</p><p>Turns out, people do things and say things and think COMPLETELY differently to me.</p><p>I cannot assume MY motives on THEIR actions.</p><p>More often than not, people have some completely magical strange mysctical reasons to doing things that do not follow my logic at all.</p><p>I think that this is empathy.</p><p>Like there are literally millions of reasons and life experiences that affect us in so many different ways.</p><p>I think that unlocking this feeling is a part of my journey of thinking about <a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/free-will>free will</a>.</p><p>We are just increasing our own anger by thinking if we were in their position we would do things differently.</p><p><em>Let&rsquo;s take someone sitting on the bus with their backpack on the seat next to them.</em></p><p>You can either sit with your own anger inside yourself:</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;WHY DO THEY HAVE THEIR BAG ON THE SEAT, THAT&rsquo;S NOT WHAT I WOULD DO. THEY ARE SO RUDE RIGHT NOW. GOD. THIS PERSON ONLY THINKS ABOUT THEMSELVES. FUCKING SELFISH PRICK.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>But maybe they have some other mystical reason that we are not aware of for their behaviour. An empathic approach to this would be something like:</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;Hmm, there is a million reasons why they could have their bag next to them. Maybe i should try to assume that they either have a good reason, or just forgetting. Maybe they are having a panic attack right now and literally are thinking about dying, maybe they feel uncomfortable with some stranger sitting right next to them, perhaps they have some trauma they deal with.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>This whole empathy thing is literally making me a little bit happier, so i cannot recommend it enough.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s be nicer.</p></div></main></body></html>
