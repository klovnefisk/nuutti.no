Imagine if a packet of ham was only called &ldquo;meat flavoured no addatives&rdquo;.</p><p>YOU WOULD WANT IT CONFIRMED THAT THIS INDEED IS MEAT.</p><p><em>Meat flavoured no addatives</em> is not enough information to make any rational human being make this purchase.</p><p>Perhaps this is is how i find myself drinking this&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;Thing&mldr;</p><p>&mldr;Drink?&mldr;</p><p>Liquid.</p><p>That directly translates to</p><h3 id=hyldeblomst-flauvour-sugar-free><strong>HYLDEBLOMST flauvour sugar-free.</strong></h3><p>Now, as I&rsquo;ve been writing this so far, I&rsquo;ve been eating some chips, so i am feeling quite thirsty.</p><p>But first, the smell test:</p><p>This smells like&mldr;</p><p>Ehh&mldr; I&rsquo;m not sure i like it.</p><p>It kind of smells like some healthy skin-product.</p><p>It smells like a foot-ointment.</p><p>I can&rsquo;t say i look forward to drinking this.</p><p>First i will pour some in my glass.</p><p>However, i am immediately noticing an empirical flaw in my review process.</p><p>I have already put water in my glass, so i will have to pour the Hyldeblomst flavoured liquid into my water glass..</p><p>Anyone who has dabbled in flavoured-drink-concentrates before will know that this is the wrong order.</p><p>The water comes in <strong>after the flavoury mystery liquid,</strong> because its easier to measure flavoured liquid in an empty mug.</p><p>Pouring the correct amount of flavour-liquid is <em><strong>ESSENTIAL</strong></em> for a successful thirst quenching experience.</p><p>However, I am yet again reminded of how thirsty i am. Here i go pouring.</p><p>Okay, i have now poured the flavour into the glass of water. The colour is a light tan - yellow. If the liquid was for example red, it would be much easier to eyeball the correct amount by the colour.</p><p>I will now take a sip. I am so thirsty.</p><p>MMMMM.</p><p>Hmmmm&mldr;</p><p>Ewwww&mldr;</p><p>Okay, first things first. The first thoguht (i will keep this typo in, because i think its funny) that comes to my head is that this is very sweet. It feels like there is a lot of sugar in this.</p><p>But &ldquo;Sugarfree&rdquo; is one of the few descriptions we get from the shit name of this product, so it cant be real sugar.</p><p>It really goes to show how far the artificial flavouring industry has come.</p><p>That makes me think i have put too much concentrate into the drink. I will now try to water it down by pouring some luke-warm water from a glass that has been sitting on my windowsill untouched for like two days. What could go wrong?</p><p>Â </p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Â </p><p>I spilled everywhere.</p><p>Â </p><p>&mldr;</p><p>Â </p><p>&mldr;
Â </p><p>Oh well, luckily only a little bit went on my computer, so i can keep writing the review.</p><p>I will now take another sip.</p><p>STILL SO FREAKING SWEET.</p><p>More water.</p><p>I luckily didn&rsquo;t spill any more.</p><p>I also ate a palette cleansing barbeque flavoured chip.</p><p>With this additional glass of water, this is finally starting to taste o.k.</p><p>What even is hyldeblomst?</p><p>I need to google.</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;Sambacus nigra is a species complex of flowering plants in the family Adoxaceae native to most of Europe. Common names incude elder, elderberry, European elder, European elderberry, and European blackelderberry.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>Okay this is unrelated to my current taste-test, but holy shit i hate the way Wikipedia writes about stuff. WHO WRITES LIKE THAT. Who is Wikipedia made for?? Its just such a horrible way to convey scientific information!!!! The way Wikipedia tries to remain objective and neutral in its language makes it into a jumbo mess of jargon that nobody - not even scientists can have any use of&mldr;.</p><p>Anyway, back to the tasting.</p><p>Earlier i was on the fence but I&rsquo;ve made up my mind.</p><p>Its shit.</p><p>I fucking hate it.</p><p>And since i refuse to throw it in the trash, i will have to drink a total of 12litres of it&mldr;</p><p>Why do i keep buying these&mldr;</p></div></main></body></html>
