Not wearing a mask.</p><p><em>&ldquo;hey i saw you walking on the street earlier, but i didn&rsquo;t want to disturb, you looked like you were mentally on another planet&rdquo;</em></p><p>A girl recently told me that my brain is too heavy from carrying so many thoughts, and its affecting my posture.</p><p>I even met a comedian here in Copenhagen, who told me i think too much.</p><p>Let that sink in&mldr;</p><p><em><strong>A COMEDIAN TOLD ME I THINK TOO MUCH.</strong></em></p><p><em>Thinking is almost the entire job description of comedian.</em></p><p>So then i really must have a problem with this entire thinking thing.</p><p>Am i thinking TOO MUCH??</p><p>My dad would often go all in on things he was doing.</p><p>Often i see my dad in my own actions.</p><p>I go all in. Everything has to be 100% all the time.</p><p>When things don&rsquo;t go like i envisioned, i often get really depressed. I&rsquo;m a failure.</p><p>I am an insecure and self-conscious man.</p><p><strong>I find others observations of me concerningly fascinating.</strong></p><p>I know everbody loves talking about themselves.</p><p>I wish i didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not even interesting!</p><p>It would be so cool to just not care about me.</p><p>Every thought spent on thinking about stupid me, is time taken away from thinking about actually important shit.</p><p>I want to become a super-material man!</p><p>In my free time in Trondheim, I made videos for a student mediahouse. There we have a tradition of writing anonymous nice things about each other every semester.</p><p>These things are the best. They&rsquo;re like free data material for my anthropological autistic brain. We feed each others egos with compliments like cattle in a feeding row. We feast on these affirmations about ourselves.</p><p><em>Even when I&rsquo;ve had the <strong>worst time of my life</strong>, people still notice some good stuff about me.</em></p><p>On paper, this should be nice, but on the other hand, this goes to show the disconnect between the perception of me, and my actual feelings.</p><p>Sometimes, i feel as though these nice compliments are throwing me further into a caricature of myself.</p><p>I am being <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization>flanderized.</a></p><p>I am flanderizing myself.</p><pre><code>All my complex essential traits are being oversimplified to the point where they constitute my entire personality.
</code></pre><p>As a comedian i can easily justify talking about myself as research.</p><p>I need to be goofy, and i need to be fun.</p><p>After slowly crawling out of a deep depression, i had some good news for an aquintance of mine.</p><p>She said <em>&ldquo;Thats so great to hear! Does that mean you&rsquo;ll be funny again??&rdquo;</em></p><p>&mldr;</p><p>How would <em>you</em> respond to someone saying that?</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>I cried.</p><p>&mldr;</p><p>I need to have unique thoughts, <a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/anyone-could-do-that/>they need to be better than average.</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve often thought that my personality only exists in society, and not in my head.</p><p>If i was alone in the world with only myself, i don&rsquo;t think i would be me.</p><p>So then who am i?</p><p>Am i me, or am i the society around me?</p><p>If i could just be myself that would be nice.</p><p>I just think that all these thoughts are getting in the way!</p></div></main></body></html>
