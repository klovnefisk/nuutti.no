She said i was annoying until she realised I&rsquo;m not doing a bit or being in character, I&rsquo;m just actually like this.</p><p>So yes, I suppose I am an aquired taste, like a Dijon mustard. Especially when i was younger.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also gotten this feedback when doing standup. Some audiences find me strange, and quite honestly i don&rsquo;t blame them.</p><p>I also think I am weird and off putting sometimes hahah. Luckily, my standup persona is different from my normal way of being.</p><p>A pro comedian that i respect once gave me an advice:</p><p>&ldquo;Nuutti, you can&rsquo;t just walk on stage and not acknowledge the fact that you are what you are.&rdquo;</p><p>I thought that was funny - so now I&rsquo;m going to give a brief professional description of my stand up comedy to you, my dear blog readers.</p><p>Perhaps this will make my job a tiny bit easier, if you ever come to see one of my shows.</p><p>My comedy can be described as <em>funny observations of everyday things with a humorous twist, often intermingled with absurd or physical elements.</em></p><p>BOOM. Do you feel <em>enlightened??</em> do you feel <em>prepared</em>??? Are you marinated and primed for COMEDY?!?!?!</p><p>No? I guess you&rsquo;ll have to see me and make up your own mind.</p></div></main></body></html>
