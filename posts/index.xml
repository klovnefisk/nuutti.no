I don&amp;rsquo;t know if its&amp;rsquo;s something that will disappear as i further develop my creative skillset.
Although many people think creative work is a skill - I don&amp;rsquo;t.
In the search of becoming funnier, smarter and better at writing I&amp;rsquo;ve been forced to dissect the frog of creativity, and I don&amp;rsquo;t like it!
THe famous saying by E.B. White
&amp;quot;Explaining a joke is like dissecting a frog.</description></item><item><title>public toilet piss puddles.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/piss-puddles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/piss-puddles/</guid><description>A short tale about the creation of public toilet piss puddles.
It may begin as a small innocent dribble in front of the toilet bowl, but it will inevitably grow into a bigger body of piss.
You may enter the booth, not intending to make the problem any worse, but at a certain point you may have your hand forced.
Unless you intend to sacrifice your shoes to the cocktail of piss spilled all over the floor.</description></item><item><title>early april in Trondheim.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/spring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/spring/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on a black state sponsored double decker bus - because the railways have been privatized by the previous conservative government.
It&amp;rsquo;s 17 o&amp;rsquo;clock and theres still some sunlight left. It&amp;rsquo;s spring, but the plants didn&amp;rsquo;t get the memo.
The trees do not have leaves.
They look like giant old brooms that poke up from the ground. The branches look like upside down roots.
We&amp;rsquo;re driving past fields.
I say &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo;, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually not helping at all.</description></item><item><title>endless consumption.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/indulging-capitalism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/indulging-capitalism/</guid><description>BUY THIS. BUY THAT. CONSUME CONSCIOUSLY.
Yes indeed, i sometimes indulge in this capitalist perversion.
Buying stuff for my image, not necessity.
I buy stuff just to show my moral qualities to other materialists.
&amp;ldquo;I bought this used, I&amp;rsquo;m such a good person. Look at how good I am.&amp;rdquo;
I have a certain taste in clothing, that tells a story of how i am.
I want to scare away corporate fast fashion.</description></item><item><title>trapped in time.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/trapped-in-time/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/trapped-in-time/</guid><description>This blogpost was originally written september 2023. Time passes at a subjective speed. So how do i want to experience my time?
Slow or fast?
Do i want my time to feel long and dreadful, or fast &amp;amp; furious?
The human experience feels like a crazy compilation of different stages of life, that you can only distiguish in retrospect.
One chapter of life seemlessly gliding onto the next.
Life is going super fast, and always changing at a rapid pace.</description></item><item><title>a simple search.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/search-funtion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/search-funtion/</guid><description>Every day we interact with digital software without considering how easily we can find things.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever used old technology, such as an old Nokia dumbphone, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably felt the pain of navigating paths and menus to find what you are looking for.
If you want to find something in a library you need to look at the category and alphabetical order of the authors name. Perhaps you need to navigate different floors and bookshelves.</description></item><item><title>anthropomorphism &amp; discovering empathy.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/anthropomorphism/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/anthropomorphism/</guid><description>I discovered empathy: wtf?
This blogpost highlights my under-developed brain, or perhaps some sort of autism, as i feel everyone else just knows this stuff.
I think i discovered empathy through the concept of anthropomorphism.
Most of us learned about this word in school. The most boring way to explain it is as a &amp;ldquo;literary device&amp;rdquo; where we transfer human qualities to non human entities such as animals, gods, or nature phenomena.</description></item><item><title>where am i?</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/where-am-i/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/where-am-i/</guid><description>My friends want to go to the bar i think is shit.
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to have less hate in my heart, so i make little to no resistance. I want to highlight positive things: not focus on the negative!
But still I can&amp;rsquo;t help myself from making a snarky remark to one of my friends. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t like this bar either. We&amp;rsquo;ve talked about it before.
While walking to the bar I asked her if the guy we met earlier is her boyfriend.</description></item><item><title>one door closes.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/one-door-closes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/one-door-closes/</guid><description>They say &amp;ldquo;when one door closes, another one opens.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes you can mistake a door as open, when in reality it&amp;rsquo;s just off it&amp;rsquo;s hinges. Broken, crazy, OUT OF PLACE.
Maybe the door has just been repainted and you get wet paint on you.
Sometimes it feels as if my door is completely locked and I&amp;rsquo;ve lost the key somewhere, i fear that i will never be able to open.</description></item><item><title>christmas.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/christmas/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/christmas/</guid><description>Imagine being born into a house from which you cant escape. This is what society can feel like sometimes.
Traditionally in the history of my own existence i have been what many would call a &amp;ldquo;hater&amp;rdquo;.
Its good in one sense, because it has developed my critical thinking skills, and has very much shaped my sense of humour.
What nobody tells you about being a hater, is that you rarely get to enjoy anything for yourself.</description></item><item><title>meant to be?</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/meant-to-be/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/meant-to-be/</guid><description>People keep telling me if it was meant to be, it would&amp;rsquo;ve been.
But that line of reasoning assumes i didn&amp;rsquo;t make a huge mistake.
And we all know people make mistakes.
Especially me.
I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of loving.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been happy alone.
Since i was a teenager I&amp;rsquo;ve been jumping from one relationship to another.
The small gaps of time where i was single have felt horrible.
It feels scary to know that another person holds the power to send me back into the horrible lonely existence whenever they feel like it.</description></item><item><title>basement shit.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/basement-shit/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/basement-shit/</guid><description>I go to the toilet in the basement of my campus in order to take a shit in peace.
It&amp;rsquo;s what some would call
&amp;ldquo;intentional living&amp;rdquo;.
Taking choices in my everyday life that make my life feel like i have control of it.
Some order in my chaotic everyday life.
There are many restrooms on campus, but i go out of my way to walk to the basement.
Sometimes this commute is a considerable detour from where i have class.</description></item><item><title>coffee cups.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/coffee-cups/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/coffee-cups/</guid><description>You would have loved this caf√©.
You would&amp;rsquo;ve especially loved this cup that my coffee came in.
I know exactly what you love about cups.
You always liked big cups, and i always liked smaller cups.
These cups are big, and they have a really nice handle.
You would have loved these cups.
These cups have a texture and colour that i KNOW you would love.
But we don&amp;rsquo;t know each other anymore.</description></item><item><title>mazes.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/mazes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/mazes/</guid><description>I biked through completely new landscapes. Never knowing what comes behind the next turn.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been on these outskirts of Copenhagen before.
For once, i was outside before everyone else.
I am underdressed.
When i left my home yesterday, i wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to sleep somewhere else.
The morning fog looks epic, but the moisture in the air makes for an annoying conductor of low temperatures.
Before i sat down, i tried to dry my bike seat, but since the bike leather is damaged, i basically sat on a wet sponge soaked in freezing water.</description></item><item><title>starting to think I think too much.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/1/</guid><description>look at me I am writing a blog, having sex with feminists, reading stupid books and still being lazy about everything.
I study sociology, theology, politics.
I think I&amp;rsquo;m so fucking clever.
I&amp;rsquo;m not.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had people spot me on the street, thinking. Not wearing a mask.
&amp;ldquo;hey i saw you walking on the street earlier, but i didn&amp;rsquo;t want to disturb, you looked like you were mentally on another planet&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>restaurant menu's.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/free-will/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/free-will/</guid><description>Ever since i discovered that unless i believe in some divine entity, I don&amp;rsquo;t have free will, I&amp;rsquo;ve stopped reading menus of restaurants.
I go by some arbitrary metric that is not related to the food.
Sometimes my friends are caught by surprise.
We enter the food establishment that one of us chose based on a google maps rating algorithm that we trust blindly. Before any of us have seen what they have to offer, i exclaim</description></item><item><title>real time taste test.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/saftreview/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/saftreview/</guid><description>Today i will be doing a real-time taste test / review.
Effectively, this means that i am writing my thoughts in real time, as i for the first time in my life taste a danish drink called &amp;ldquo;Hyldeblomst Smag Sukkerfri&amp;rdquo;.
The keen eyed, norwegian or danish speaking community might have noticed that the name of this product does not have a noun, but only adjectives.
That is beyond blasphemous.</description></item><item><title>collateral abandonment - post mortem.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/miss-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/miss-you/</guid><description>Its been a year and a half. if i knew I&amp;rsquo;d loose you too, maybe I would&amp;rsquo;ve stayed with her.
I sent you a message the other day but it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel the same.
I mean, i never expected it to feel the same, but this wasn&amp;rsquo;t even in the same ballpark.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what i was hoping for, but still i was disappointed.
I understand.
Maybe you&amp;rsquo;ve been told something bad about me.</description></item><item><title>biking home.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/bike/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/bike/</guid><description>I am numb to sensory input.
The creaks from my bike are the only thing that confirms me of the fact that i am moving.
I am in fact moving, and the road seems to wobble as well.
In my backpack i have a wet taquito from 7 eleven.
I had to save the second one for later, because the first one was so spicy.
The warm, soft and tender texture of a taquito is almost a homo-erotic sensation.</description></item><item><title>muscle memory miscalibration.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/muscle-memory/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/muscle-memory/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made a grave error in my muscle memory calibration.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had the same password on my computer for years. Today we are not going to be discussing the safety ramifications of this, or if its a good idea to tell the internet about it.
I might have to change it either way after what i&amp;rsquo;ve just done.
My real problem has occurred during the last 9 days.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been quick at writing my password, and it seems that i&amp;rsquo;ve finally reached the peak of just how quickly i can write it.</description></item><item><title>smiles of Copenhagen.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/some-people-smile-to-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/some-people-smile-to-me/</guid><description>For some reason, multiple people have seen me and smiled to me here.
This feels unusual as i am used to operating under the assumption that nobody wants to feel like i exist as i walk past them. When i am standing in line at a grocery store, my existence is an inconvenience to everyone else there.
This is how I&amp;rsquo;ve viewed others, and how i assumed that others view me as well.</description></item><item><title>laptop legion.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/cafe-laptops/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/cafe-laptops/</guid><description>As often is the case, i am yet again a part of a problem only i seem to care about.
I rarely feel the itch to write a blogpost about something, but today was an exception.
My favourite coffeeshop has too many laptops! They are ugly fugly and poop.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to walk into a coffeeshop only to see a god damn roman tortoise shield formation of laptops facing me!</description></item><item><title>moving.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/moving/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/moving/</guid><description>&amp;quot;Really makes ya think, huh?&amp;quot; Moving means relocating you, and everything you own from A to B. This week, i am moving, but i dont know where i will end up. I do not yet have another home to go to. I am terrified. I can physically feel the fear in my body. I feel it in my stomach. The stressful fear is enough to make my balls shrivel up. I fear they will climb back into my ass, where i assume they came from.</description></item><item><title>unstoppable.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/unstoppable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/unstoppable/</guid><description>I recetly came across an interesting saying:
‚ÄúIf a man knows not which port he sails, no wind is favorable.‚Äù
In another similar, but different sense: without a destination, one cannot be stopped.
Therefore it seems the easy way to becoming unstoppable, is not having a goal.
This is why setting goals feels scary.
As always there is a happy medium. If i can learn how to enjoy the journey, any detour will feel like an extension to something enjoyable.</description></item><item><title>anyone could do that!</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/anyone-could-do-that/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/anyone-could-do-that/</guid><description>I feel compelled to justify my existence.
If i want to say something it ought to be good. It should be funny or important. It needs to be at least better than &amp;ldquo;something anyone could do.&amp;rdquo;
However, a parodox emerges from this.
I am anyone. &amp;ldquo;anyone could do that&amp;rdquo;
And here is anyone doing it.
You get me?
I ought to do it better than anyone.
Who am I competing against?</description></item><item><title>fences.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/fences/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/fences/</guid><description>To me, a fence is a hostile piece of architecture.
Made to keep me out, but also made to keep someone in.
Why cant i go there. Why cant they come out.
Often a fence is more like a suggestion.
A local cemetary has a waist high fence all the way around it. If we assume that it is not to keep the dead people from getting out, then this fence seems like a futile attempt at keeping me from pissing on these graves.</description></item><item><title>e-mail.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/mail/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/mail/</guid><description>RE: Superficial style of writing in emails. CC: your mom Hey, I have this certain superficial long winded style of writing emails. For some reason, i become suddenly more articulate, as i try to feign a sense of eloquence in my sentences. Even though i could have used fewer words, and you got all the necessary info you needed in one sentence, i will further elaborate on the one sentence, so that this email will fill some sort of arbitrary undefined length criteria that i have set for myself.</description></item><item><title>guest column 2</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/guest-column2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/guest-column2/</guid><description>This guest column is written by Amund.
I&amp;rsquo;ve known amund for years at this point, and I&amp;rsquo;ve lived with him for the last 2 years. He&amp;rsquo;s awesome, even when he wakes up annoyingly happy.
Amund is clever, funny and not least a great storyteller. He always finds himself in horrible situations that end up being a great story.

Tobias is a smart man, even though he had the odds stacked against him by being born in Narvik.
He also plays the banjo really well, and if you ask me, thats one of the greatest instruments to learn.
I&amp;rsquo;ve only known Tobias for a semester or two, and i am so happy to have him as my friend.
He sometimes writes his thoughts down, just like i do.</description></item><item><title>worms.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/worms/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/worms/</guid><description>No matter how hard i try, i cannot recall seeing a worm in years.

If they freeze for long enough, the pain stops.
I do not want the pain to stop.
I do not fear the cold, i fear the absence of it.
I wear thick wool socks with some slippers, to create layers between me and the cold ground. I don&amp;rsquo;t want the cold world to contaminate me.
More layers.
When i finally achieve the perfect temperature, i rarely remember to notice it.</description></item><item><title>lightswitches.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/buttons/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/buttons/</guid><description>In my home i have the pleasure of flicking, cranking, pressing and twisting lightswitches.
Everyone knows the classic lightswitch. It&amp;rsquo;s a square switch, that you can flick on or off. It has a quite large surface area, no aiming required. The simple design with a large surface area, allows for the signature SLAP. This is quite simply the act of slapping the lightswitch.
Safely.
Light.
Area.
Promptly.
S.L.A.P.
Now let us move onto another classic lightswitch in Norway.</description></item><item><title>commitment issues.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/commitment-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/commitment-issues/</guid><description>Commitment means saying yes for a future version of yourself.

Its not you. Its me. Well, actually -
It&amp;rsquo;s a 100% you. You&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; Old&amp;hellip; And frankly i don&amp;rsquo;t know what i ever saw in you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found NEW a brush with bristles that look shiny, and straight.
Your bristles are all fucked up and fuzzy. You&amp;rsquo;re not the brush i once picked at the store.</description></item><item><title>HAPPY SPOOKTOBER</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/happy-spooktober/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/happy-spooktober/</guid><description>the SPOOKIEST MONTH OF THE YEAAARRRRR Spooky scary skeletons.

Great song indeed.
It reminds me of the discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve had with j√¶vla s√∏ringa.
So many people from Oslo consider Trondheim as the first city of northern norway. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense at all. I am currently, in late september basking in the southern sun beaming upon my forehead. Do you ever feel self counscious about the size or shape of your forehead?
Me neither.</description></item><item><title>on starving.</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/</guid><description>811 million people. 10% of everyone on this planet go hungry regularly. Thats fucking nuts, man.
I usually end up starving because of my own stupidity.
I am my own worst enemy.
Sundays. Sundays are my &amp;ldquo;starving days&amp;rdquo;
Usually i wake up feeling as one should feel on a lovely sunday morning.
Super mega ultra hungover.
I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie. I should probably maybe drink less.
Sometimes when i wake up, i catch myself wondering: Am i ever going to feel hydrated again?</description></item><item><title>R√∏d</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/roed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/roed/</guid><description>Todays blogpost is special, but only because it&amp;rsquo;s not special AT ALL. Todays topic is so impressively, and UTTERLY un-interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;s the first color of the rainbow, from the top down.
The colour of blood, hell, and pain.
But simultaniously also the colour of love.
Ah, the duality of red!
The colour of leftist politics in europe, but then across the pond red is associated with the republicans.
It&amp;rsquo;s ironic how communists and MAGA lunatics have this strong colour in common.</description></item><item><title>Kirkegata 61a experience</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/kirkegata-61a-experience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/kirkegata-61a-experience/</guid><description>Kirkegata 61a experience. Omgivelse + cast N√•r man synker ned i kjelleren, forbi den r√•tne mugghula som har varmtvannstanken v√•r, glemme man fort at det e sol ute. I kjellern e det alltid m√∏rkt. I kjellern blir man truffet av en vegg med egglukt, da hele kollektivet spiser hovedsakelig stekte egg, til hvert eneste m√•ltid. Veggene har samme gulfarge som en hvit tskjorte som har blitt svetta og smurt med solkrem.</description></item><item><title>HELLO WORLD</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>My first post This website is my digital canvas.
However, i will not be doing any art, or painting for that matter! (well, perhaps?) I will be spewing my thoughts, into the void, for the world wide web to see. There will be (un)funny stories, how to&amp;rsquo;s, and whatever else comes out of my brain. Completely unprocessed and raw.
I will be vomiting ideas onto this digital canvas.
Spraying my non-intellectual diarrhea into this cesspool we call the internet.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/cigarettes-and-death/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/cigarettes-and-death/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/give-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/give-up/</guid><description>Fuck you happy people.
I&amp;rsquo;m not particularily happy with the world, or with our culture.
I&amp;rsquo;m more optimistic than that.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think the current status quo is inevitable, unchangeable or &amp;ldquo;the best we can do&amp;rdquo;.
If i were to be happy with the world, i would be happy for all the suffering, and inequality it contains.
As Nietsche said so nicely: To say yes to one instant is to say yes to all of existence.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/greenergrass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/greenergrass/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/imperfect-blog/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/imperfect-blog/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/understandconservatives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/understandconservatives/</guid><description>it boils down to morals
During my time in university I have learned so much.
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to run with a sickpack of beer without shaking the cans.
Stabilized beer running. ‚úîÔ∏è
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to be the worst neighbour. The key is to NOT turn down the volume.
worst neighbour ever ‚úîÔ∏è
I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to burn spaghetti. The recipe is quite simple:
An inadequate amount of water mixed with Extreme amounts of spaghetti combined with the aboslute highest heat setting Results guaranteed.</description></item></channel></rss>
