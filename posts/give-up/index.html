In a more fair manner. So, why should i be happy with how things are looking?</p><p>I&rsquo;m not particularily happy with myself either.</p><p>I used to be more miserable.</p><p>I used to think that i should try to be happy, but the moment i accepted my misery it disappeared.</p><p>If we accept the world how it is, the misery of it disappears.</p><p>Too many people are trying to fix their own life.</p><p>That shit is overrated.</p><p>Jordan Peterson is telling people to &ldquo;clean your room before you change the world&rdquo;.</p><p>I think the state of my room is irrelevant to the world.</p><p>I used to be very unhappy with my experiences and our world, but now I&rsquo;ve realised that searching for happiness is searching for a suitable coping mechanism to accepting the cruel world.</p><p>Whenever i see someone who is happy i can look down at them, from my superior high horse of morals.</p><p>Yes, i can inflate my own sense of superiority: ALL HAPPY PEOPLE ARE DUMB.</p><p>But now I am stuck with slowly becoming happier because I&rsquo;ve accepted this miserable life of self-importance and pretentiousness and now I&rsquo;m slipping away from the very thing i took so much pride in.</p><p>And I&rsquo;m going to keep blaming happy people for all my problems.</p><p>As my final point, my definition of happy is not smiling, or being contempt.</p><p>Because i smile a lot, i am contempt and i am grateful for what i have.</p><p>HAPPY people simply do stuff without thinking. That is happiness. Doing, consuming, travelling. Not thinking about the consequences of their actions.</p><p>That is happiness. To live life and do things without a worry in the world.</p><p>As the great Thunberg said: How dare you.</p></div></main></body></html>
