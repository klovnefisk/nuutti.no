But i could only take so many no&rsquo;s when i already felt so weak.</p><p>After asking <em>them</em> so many times, and getting so many painful rejections, I couldn&rsquo;t bare yours too.</p><p>The others wouldn&rsquo;t even spare me an honest no.</p><p>I would talk to <em>them</em>, try to invite them, but all i got was a horrible, cold, norwegian shoulder.</p><p>After everything we had, was this all i was worth?</p><p>Not even a reply? Or even worse: &ldquo;a busy schedule?&rdquo;</p><p>That is why i could not ask you too.</p><p>No. I could not bare it.</p><p>I was too scared and weak. I couldn&rsquo;t take a final no from you too.
I did not want to see you weasel away from me like <em>the others</em>.</p><p>Slowly my expectations started slipping downwards, closer to zero. That was the worst part. A slow descent into mutual abandonment.</p><p>In the end i realised that they are more devoted to social order than to justice. It fills me with rage and regret. I wish i at least went out guns blazing. I wish i wasn&rsquo;t so nice to all of them. Maybe i could&rsquo;ve gotten some small satisfaction if i got to call them dickheads or something. I guess everything i wanted, was to say <em>something, anything.</em></p><p><strong>I remember driving with you</strong> through those beautiful postcard landscapes, while listening to Billie Eilish&rsquo;s &ldquo;no time to die&rdquo;.</p><p>I really enjoyed those rides.</p><p>If i ever saw you again, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;d react. I&rsquo;ve decided that I don&rsquo;t respect <em>them</em>.</p><p>But in my heart, I&rsquo;ve made an exeption for you. I don&rsquo;t know why.
Maybe it&rsquo;s because you moved before everything happened. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you are special.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t miss <em>her</em>.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t miss <em>them</em>.</p><p><strong>I miss you.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BboMpayJomw">Was it obvious to everybody else?</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BboMpayJomw">That I&rsquo;d fallen for a lie</a></p><p>Â </p><p>I hope you&rsquo;re well.</p><p>Â </p></div></main></body></html>
