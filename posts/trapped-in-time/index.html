Dreadful indeed!</p><p><em>I want to really experience every second.</em></p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to be stuck in a perpetual flow state that i will look back at.</p><p>Most memories feel like a short while in my mind.</p><p>I biked from Trondheim to Oslo in a week. That week felt long when i was in it, but now it feels like a short weird story that i can tell in one sentence.</p><p>But the bodily experience of the time passing, while biking the norwegian countryside for days cannot be underestimated.</p><p>It felt bad at the time - and the hours and days spent on the bike felt like an eternity.</p><p>Maybe pain is the only path to slow seconds?</p><p>If I&rsquo;m having normal fun, every second becomes indistinguishable from each other. Sometimes even hours can pass without noticing.</p><p>How can i make happy seconds last longer?</p><p>If you really need to pee and you need to wait for the toilet, every second is truly felt.</p><p>If someone is telling a story that just drags on for ages the time moves in super slowmotion.</p><p>How can i make happy seconds last longer?</p><p>I want my life to drag on. I want to feel every second of my joy, just like i feel every second of my pain.</p><p>All the terrible seconds last for a lifetime, and the happy seconds pass me by in the blink of an eye.</p><p>How can i make happy seconds last longer?</p><p>People talk about living life &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo; but I&rsquo;m not interested in that.</p><p>I just want to truly <em>feel</em> and experience a <em><strong>lifetime</strong></em>.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not talking about living life that is filled with a lot of stories. That entails the danger of passing through time too quickly.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want stories, i just want to really feel like I&rsquo;ve lived so many minutes that its getting boring. I want to physically experience every minute in such a manner that i grow tired of experiencing them.</p><p>Just like when you&rsquo;re on a never-ending car ride, or listening to a story that just drags on for ages, you truly feel time pass in a bodily manner.</p><p><strong>That</strong> is how i want my life to feel. Like some horrible experience that just <em>drags</em> on until i don&rsquo;t want it anymore.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want a fast life where i enjoyed everything so much that i forgot to feel time passing.</p><p>Time happens to me, and i am trapped in it.</p><p>-feel the pain.</p><p>Â </p></div></main></body></html>
