I want to highlight positive things: not focus on the negative!</p><p>But still I can&rsquo;t help myself from making a snarky remark to one of my friends. She doesn&rsquo;t like this bar either. We&rsquo;ve talked about it before.</p><p>While walking to the bar I asked her if the guy we met earlier is her boyfriend.</p><p>She says she is &ldquo;inbetween boyfriends right now&rdquo;.</p><p>LOL.</p><p>She&rsquo;s in limbo.</p><p>What a life.</p><p>She&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p><p>Lost between two spaces in time.</p><p>She&rsquo;s in that half blank page before the next chapter of a book.</p><p>Stuck between the worst part of a relationship and perhaps the best part of a relationship:</p><p>The end and the beginning.</p><p><a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/one-door-closes/>I guess it&rsquo;s true what they say about one door closing&mldr;</a></p><p>Something about another door&mldr;</p><p><em><strong>&ldquo;inbetween boyfriends&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>Â </p><p>Me?</p><p>Well&mldr;</p><p>I&rsquo;m inbetween jobs if that helps.</p><p>My job is essentially just a side hustle.</p><p>Maybe some relationships are side hustles.</p><p>Dating a very independent person can kind of feel like that.</p><p>Like you&rsquo;re someones side hustle.</p><p>Like you&rsquo;re being hustled on the side.</p><p>Â </p><p><em>The bouncer asks me for my ID.</em></p><p>I cant believe i have to show my ID to get in somewhere <strong>i don&rsquo;t even want to go!</strong></p><p>Â 
I can&rsquo;t wait to have a beer in my hand.</p><p>As i take out my wallet to pay the very kind man behind the bar, i realise i am absolutely sloshed.</p><p>My friend tells me she is drunk enough to dance.</p><p>I agree. MEEE tooÂ°Â°Â°Â°Â°&mldr;.ðŸ¥´</p><p>When drunk brain makes decision to dance, body goes into autopilot.</p><p>We walk into the basement, and god damn this place SUCKS.</p><p>There&rsquo;s too much fog. Not enough people, and the music is also shit.</p><p>I start to wonder what i am doing with my life, but then i remember i don&rsquo;t care about the grand scheme of my life.</p><p>IM TRYING TO WELCOME HAPPINESS HERE.
I DO NOT CONSENT TO A <em>TINGLING SPIDER SENSE TO PESSIMISM IN MY BRAIN.</em></p><p>Unfortunately I am not the captain of the ship that carries my thoughts.</p><p>At this bar, a few weekends ago two super hot chicks with croptops, boots and piercings were hitting on me.</p><p>My Italian friend saw one them first. He had dibs.</p><p>I didn&rsquo;t mind, since they were terrifyingly attractive. The type of girls who would stop liking me when i start talking.</p><p>It was a nice confidence boost though.</p><p>I still get happy thinking about it.</p><p>External sources of happiness are my guilty pleasure.</p><p>If i experienced this kind of desire every weekend, i would probably also consider myself</p><p>&ldquo;inbetween girlfriends&rdquo;.</p><p>But I dont.</p><p>So I think I&rsquo;m just lonely.</p></div></main></body></html>
