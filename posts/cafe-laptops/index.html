They are ugly fugly and poop.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t want to walk into a coffeeshop only to see a god damn roman tortoise shield formation of laptops facing me!! It&rsquo;s not a welcoming vibe, to feel as if a military legion is defending themselves from a array of arrows.</p><p>Bonus cringepoints if these laptops are Macs or some epic 733T GAMING EPIC ASUS laptop.</p><p>I feel the irony as i sit at my regular cafe, for the first time on my laptop, writing about how laptops are ruining this place&mldr;</p><p>My excuse is that i am homeless, and have been yearning for a place to write my blog. I could be at a library now, that is true. But i enjoy sitting at a cafe. Usually i will read the newspapers, or stare into the air as if i were some deep stoic thinker. The truth being, i am a dumb homeless 23year old idiot. Perhaps i am fooling myself into thinking that my thoughts are in any way worth thinking, simply because i am thinking them.</p><p>As i have become homeless, i find myself thinking quite a lot, and spending most of my time alone. In Trondheim, i could spend this time writing on this blog for example, or my many standup sets that often take hours to craft, as i find myself distracted in the different paths at the forest of ideas.</p><p>All this, is to justify my use of this laptop in this cafe. I&rsquo;m trying to actually compile my ideas on this subject, and construct an argument against it.</p><p>I guess i could forgive someone using a laptop at a cafe, if they are writing a blog, or editing photos. You know, something fun.</p><p>I see some of these laptop madlads doing excel spreadsheets -> what the fuck. Go to your office?</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also seen people programming at bars and cafes. I don&rsquo;t consider this as bad as other things, but i don&rsquo;t think the coffee shop should be a place of work, or productivity. It shouldn&rsquo;t be an office, and if you make it into your office, you are bringing the work vibe with you.</p><p>Normal people with actual real jobs (not laptop remote work spreadsheet nerds) deserve a place that&rsquo;s away from work, that does not involve alcohol.</p><p>Now, i am going back to enjoying my real life at this coffee shop. The barista just put on some radiohead on their vinylplayer.</p><p>-stay analogue.</p></div></main></body></html>
