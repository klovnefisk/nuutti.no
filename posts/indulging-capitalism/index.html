BUY THAT. CONSUME CONSCIOUSLY.</p><p>Yes indeed, i sometimes indulge in this capitalist perversion.</p><p>Buying stuff for my image, not necessity.</p><p>I buy stuff just to show my moral qualities to other materialists.</p><p>&ldquo;I bought this used, I&rsquo;m such a good person. Look at how good I am.&rdquo;</p><p>I have a certain taste in clothing, that tells a story of how i am.</p><p>I want to scare away corporate fast fashion.</p><p>Or rather, i want to scare away that which it symbolizes.</p><p>Like a scarecrow, i want to repel the birds whom flock to feast on the field of seeds.</p><p>Seeds that were set by a billion dollar corporation.</p><p><strong>I try to warn them:</strong>
<em>No. Do not indulge in these seeds. They are planted here for profit.</em></p><p><em>We can all become immaterial. Dress how we want.</em></p><p>However, in my attempt at conscious consumption, i still consume.</p><p>I want to appeal to immaterial people, yet here I am, being material.</p><p>I want to scare away materialists, but turns out i only end up attracting a different species of them.</p><p>Instead of appealing to the masses who consume without thought, I become a part of a different mass.</p><p>A mass that jumps through mental hoops before purchase.</p><p>Many of these thrift store dwellers might not be mindless consumers, but they are arguably even more material than their counterparts.</p><p>Yes indeed. <em>They might be more materialistic than anyone among the mindless masses browsing fast fashion websites.</em></p><p>They might be more material in the sense that they can judge a person through more channels. The mindless consumer may judge through appearance, but the conscious consumer may also judge by it&rsquo;s narrative.</p><p>They judge by narrative and convoluted morals.</p><p>Yes, it might be morally more conscious, BUT IS THIS NOT MORE MATERIALISTIC?</p><p>What once was a simple question: Is this sweater appealing, becomes a moral action.</p><p><em>I want to remind myself that it is <strong>good</strong> to sometimes ask yourself the question: was a child forced to make these pants?</em></p><p>But often, while the clothing is worn, it becomes a matter of storytelling.</p><p>Yes, we have become considerate at the grand scale, but at what cost?
We must thread carefully as to not fall into an even deeper materialism!</p><p>Thrifting is just a different shade of consumption.</p><p>I do this too, so i am no better.</p><p>You tell me you bought it USED, and how CHEAP it was.</p><p><em>I bought this while backpacking in Vietnam for 7NOK.</em></p><p>My fellow scarecrows, lets ask ourselves: is this really better?</p><p>Our way of fetishising moral shopping is perhaps the ULTIMATE capitalist indulgement.</p><p>We might point out, that we should be fetishising morals of clothing, rather than a billion dollar brand.</p><p>Yes, it might be better to commodify a used jacket rather than a Gucci jacket.</p><p>But we have to admit, this is nothing but a compromise.</p><p>We are mere trend chasers.</p><h3 id=can-we-escape-materialism-through-these-materialistic-means>Can we escape materialism through these materialistic means?</h3><p>I dont know.</p><p>If i wish to not be percieved, i need to stop percieving others.</p></div></main></body></html>
