Today i woke up at noon.

Yesterday i woke up at noon...

EVERY DAY THIS WEEK, I've woke up at FUCKING NOON.

I can't get out of bed.

I wake up feeling bad.

I have low-emotional granularity(link), so i can't fully understand what i am even feeling.

I probably also don't have the vocabulary for it.

    Stressed, depressed and embarassed.

Another lecture I'm going to miss...

Today is friday, which is when i have my favourite class.

Last week i was an hour late to this class.

I'm embarassed but my love for the professor or whatever had me out of bed at 11. Class began at 10.

I go out and THE DAY IS DAMN NEAR PERFECT. 

Its fucking november and I'm SITTING OUTSIDE IN A TSHIRT WITH THE SUN IN MY EYES.

I'm not going to lie i felt kind of happy on my way here, and i was so stoked on writing a happy blogpost for once, but now that I'm reading this it again just still sounds depressing.

I felt a momentary happiness. That was awesome. I was biking in the sun in just a hoodie, not cold, but not sweating. Going towards my lecture. Actually doing stuff while the sun is still out!!


Being productive makes me happy. I like going to my lectures i always feel awesome afterwards.

But this week i didn't make it to a single one.
