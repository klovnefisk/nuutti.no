When i am standing in line at a grocery store, my existence is an inconvenience to everyone else there.</p><p>This is how I&rsquo;ve viewed others, and how i assumed that others view me as well.</p><p>And however twisted it might sound, I&rsquo;ve looked at people i walk past on the street, like an uncomfortable thing that should not be acknowledged.</p><p>A few years ago i talked about this with my moral council and roommates Isak and Amund.</p><p>They convinced me to try smiling to someone on the street. They told me it makes them feel a bit better, and also it feels nice to recieve smiles.</p><p>A few days later, i was walking to a pre-drinking event. The sun was shining, and i felt great. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on smiling to someone, but suddenly i got eye contact with another man who looked like he was also really enjoying himself, so i took the chance and i smiled to him.</p><p>To my surprise, my smile completely sucked the joy out of him. It&rsquo;s as if my smile released some evil spirit or one of those harry potter face eater things. It completely morphed his smile into a cold stare.</p><p>I was mortified after this event, but i was not deterred. I mean surely that guy was just weird or something. Its not like this is going to happen everytime i smile to someone?</p><p>WRONG. Everytime i smiled at someone, it seems i made their day worse.</p><p>I felt like a cockroach, who meets the terrible fate of being squashed simply for existing in the wrong place.</p><p>For a while i thought that people refused to smile to me specifically because i am not handsome or nice looking enough. I mean my roomies are really handsome after all!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve often heard people compliment their looks! Compliments i receive usually revolve around me being the subject of entertaintment. I felt like other people never had the issue of receiving smiles.</p><p>I thought that maybe my smiling technique freaked everybody out. Should i smile with teeth, or maybe nod my head simultaniously?</p><p>Then something happened that made me not want to smile for a very long time. I realised that i shouldn&rsquo;t expect anybody to smile. How could i have been so entitled, as to expect people to smile to me, or even to pretend i exist? Who did i think i was?!</p><p>I forgot all about my attempts at smiling to strangers, as everything i was looking at, was viewed through a filter of analytical negativity. Everyone hates me, and i hate everyone. Its a fine symbiotic existence with the world.</p><p>After weeks became months and months became years, this filter has slowly started to fade. It&rsquo;s happening so slowly that i havent even noticed that things look less dark now.</p><p>Here in Copenhagen, several people have smiled at me, without me initating it, or telling a joke. This has never happened in Norway.This always catches me off guard. I feel awkward and shy and maybe even a little bit unconfident as i realise what is happening. I dont want to take up this space. I am sorry for accidentally looking into your eyes.</p><p>Before i can grasp what is going on, the moment is over and the smiling stranger has passed me by, before i had time to smile back.</p><p>I cannot help but project my insecurities onto this small act of kindness.</p><p>Did they smile to me, because i look so broken that they feel bad?</p><p>Maybe i looked at them weirdly and they just smiled to me to be polite?</p><p>Does that smiling stranger want to FUCK ME?</p><p>Are these people smiling at me because i behave / look different than i did those years ago?</p><p>Maybe this same shock is what all the people i smiled to also experienced?</p><p>Yeah so i guess the smiling may be a cultural difference then?</p><p>I hope people keep smiling ;P</p></div></main></body></html>
