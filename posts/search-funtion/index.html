Perhaps you need to navigate different floors and bookshelves.</p><p>You need several steps to find what you are looking for.</p><p>I remember early smartphones having this problem. My first smartphone didn&rsquo;t have a search function within the settings. Finding the spesific setting for changing my keyboard language was awkward, and in many cases infuriating.</p><p>On older versions of Windows, the search function really didn&rsquo;t work that well either. You had to navigate through &ldquo;control panel&rdquo; and different sub-sections to find whatever you wanted to change.</p><p>Now? I type in what i need, and i find it in two seconds: Information, settings, books, apps, big boobs?</p><p>There is NO PROCESS involved in acquiring ANYTHING ANYMORE?</p><p>I wonder if this does anything to our perception of finding answers and solutions.</p><p>Today we see many people who believe in simple solutions to complex problems.</p><p>They believe that answers are a simple search away.</p><p>They think that the solution to problems in our society, lies within some simple rational, scientific answer.</p><p>As if there is some magical keyword we can type and POOF our problems away!?</p><p>Climate change is a problem? - &ldquo;CARBON TAX&rdquo;</p><p>Male lonelyness? - &ldquo;BLAME FEMINISM&rdquo;</p><p>Increased inflation? - &ldquo;LESS TAXES&rdquo;</p><p>Crime? &ldquo;CALL THE COPS&rdquo;</p><p>There is a certain elegance to these solutions, and thats exactly what makes them appealing. Unfortunately, they fucking suck most of the time.</p><p>More often than not, we need complex solutions to complex issues.</p><p>Science and rationality will not save us.</p><p>We need humans to be nice, and we need to go through difficult processes to find our solutions.</p><p><em>The solutions are not a simple buzzword away. We will most likely need to navigate some complicated path, that probably involves eating the rich if you ask me.</em></p><p>I&rsquo;ve already picked my seasoning and it&rsquo;s systematic change.</p><p>:3</p></div></main></body></html>
