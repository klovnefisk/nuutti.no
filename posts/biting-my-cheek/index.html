Ask me anything!</h1><time datetime=2022-11-13T00:00:00Z class=post-date>Sun, Nov 13, 2022</time><p>Â </p><p>The pain is excruciating. Please make this end.</p><p>I&rsquo;m a 22 year old political science student, studying at NTNU, Trondheim in Norway.</p><p>It all started with a vegan spaghetti bolognese. One of my favourite meals to cook. It&rsquo;s easy, cheap, and tasty.</p><p>And let me tell you this: I was <a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/>starving</a>.</p><p>In my hurry gorge down on this magnificent meal, i made a major techical flaw in my eating technique. A blunder for the centuries, so to say.</p><p>I accidentally bit the innside of my cheek, at the very back of my mouth, on the left side.</p><p>In plain english one could say</p><p><em>that shit hurt like a motherfucker</em></p><p>It has become exponentially worse as the days have gone by. Everytime i close my mouth i bite it. I don&rsquo;t know how to get rid of the swelling. Physically the pain is maybe a 7/10, not that bad, but mentally this has consumed me.</p><p>Every meal, and every bite accelerates my heart beat.</p><p>The despair and terror are un-invited guests of my mind.</p><p>But i literally HAVE TO EAT. This inevitably leads to me biting the cheek AGAIN.</p><p>Thats why I&rsquo;m doing this AMA. I&rsquo;m here to answer all your questions!</p><p>Feel free to ask me anything!</p><p>Â </p><p>*Edit: Thank you for the gold kind stranger!!!</p><p>*Edit: Wow, i was not expecting this many questions and advice from you guys! I will go to a lecture now but will come back to answer more questions later!</p><p>*Edit: Thanks again to everyone for being so nice! This was so much fun, thank you for yet another great AMA! I&rsquo;m going to end the AMA here, i compiled the most common questions underneath here, for easier access in the future!</p><p>Â </p><ol><li><p><em>Does spicy food hurt the open wound in your cheek?</em></p><p>YES. Holy shit. As someone who finds a mild chili flavour in their food pleasant, this whole situation has brought an involuntary spice change to my diet.</p></li><li><p><em>have you tried eating exclusively soft foods, like soups and mashes?</em></p><p>This question really pisses me off. Imagine how you would feel if you were suggested to eat only mashes and soups for an extended period of time? I&rsquo;m a god damn grown man with teeth made for chewing. But yes, I&rsquo;m keeping this as a last resort solution if this torturous pain does not pass by itself.</p></li><li><p><em>Why don&rsquo;t you just eat very carefully?</em></p><p>&mldr;. You see&mldr; Since it really doesn&rsquo;t hurt unless I&rsquo;m eating, I keep forgetting the situation until i am painfully reminded by feeling of intense pain shooting through my body.</p></li><li><p><em>Has this whole shpiel ruined your relationship with vegan bolognese</em></p><p>NO! I will not blame the food, and neither should you!</p></li><li><p><em>How is your oral hygiene affected by this traumatic event?</em></p><p>Good question! Brushing my teeth can be done, with minor tingling sensations caused by the fresh mint flavour in the toothpaste. Once however, i tried using mouthwash.</p><p>I fell to my knees, while tears poured down my cheeks onto the <a href=https://nuutti.no/posts/a-day-in-my-life/>cold bathroom floor</a>. The pain was <strong>harrowing</strong>. I am NEVER doing that again.</p></li></ol></div></main></body></html>
