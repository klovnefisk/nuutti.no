Today we are not going to be discussing the safety ramifications of this, or if its a good idea to tell the internet about it.</p><p>I might have to change it either way after what i&rsquo;ve just done.</p><p>My real problem has occurred during the last 9 days.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve always been quick at writing my password, and it seems that <em>i&rsquo;ve finally reached the peak of just how quickly i can write it.</em></p><p>Everytime i try to write it even faster than last time. The goal is to write it so fast, that i can write the entire password with just two simultaneous SLAMS on the keyboard. Almost like the Tom & Jerry scene where Tom tries to kill Jerry with the piano.</p><p>The word <em>peak</em> insinuates a decline immedeatly after, and oh boy have i declined.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve yet again found myself involuntarily taking a lesson in a familiar subject: <em><strong>&ldquo;consequences of my own actions 101.&rdquo;</strong></em></p><p>I&rsquo;ve somehow successfully trained my muscle memory into typing it wrong.
I flew too close to the sun. It&rsquo;s easy to admit in retrospect. I mean <strong>of course</strong> I was going to make things harder for myself in the long run&mldr;</p><p>I&rsquo;ve peaked, and I&rsquo;m slowly coming to terms with it.
Now everytime i write my password the first time i write it fast, but wrong. So then i remember that I&rsquo;ve miscalibrated my muscle memory, so i go back to write it a bit slower, but in reality I&rsquo;m still going too fast, so i end up having to spell it out really slowly after three miserable attempts.</p><p>I feel like a senior citizen. I&rsquo;m mouthing every single letter of the password, slowly typing it in, while reminiscing of the days where i used to speed through this process in a single second. As i slowly type in my password i look around myself and make sure to announce to my audience: <em>I USED TO BE ONE OF THE QUICKEST.</em></p><p>I could be the guy going from school to school and holding talks, warning the youth about the dangers of chasing keyboard dexterity without the proper 10finger touchtyping technique.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m not. Instead I&rsquo;m slowly losing my sanity alone, in my own brain, with the only outlet being this blog.</p><p>Is anyone there?</p><p>Is anyone reading?</p><p>Please don&rsquo;t steal my passwords.</p></div></main></body></html>
