Jordan Carter: No cap and gown, I ain&amp;rsquo;t go to class

&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d much rather just send a text or call you&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;You still use snapchat??&amp;rdquo;
In the rest of Europe, everyone just universally agrees on using whatsapp.
My own mother doesn&amp;rsquo;t pick up the phone unless i call her on Whatsapp.
A few weeks ago, she had her birthday, i called her 2 days late.</description></item><item><title>A really funny predicament for real</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/a-day-in-my-life/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/a-day-in-my-life/</guid><description>Today i tried to get out of bed for 2 hours. After all, i study political science, so it&amp;rsquo;s not like i actually have to do anything.
No reason to get out of bed. LOL!!
I have lost all discipline i once had. LOL im such a lazy slob now! LOOOLLL
I go to my kitchen, and realise i&amp;rsquo;m out of coffee filters. Since i am a man of solutions, i make a coffee with toilet paper as a filter.</description></item><item><title>A hard conversation with a toothbrush</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/breaking-up-with-a-toothbrush/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/breaking-up-with-a-toothbrush/</guid><description>Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re just a toothbrush, and maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just overthinking. But i&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to tell you&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m breaking up with you
Its not you. Its me. Well, actually -
It&amp;rsquo;s a 100% you. You&amp;rsquo;re&amp;hellip; Old&amp;hellip; And frankly i don&amp;rsquo;t know what i ever saw in you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found NEW a brush with bristles that look shiny, and straight.
Your bristles are all fucked up and fuzzy. You&amp;rsquo;re not the brush i once picked at the store.</description></item><item><title>HAPPY SPOOKTOBER</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/happy-spooktober/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/happy-spooktober/</guid><description>the SPOOKIEST MONTH OF THE YEAAARRRRR Spooky scary skeletons.

Great song indeed.
It reminds me of the discussions I&amp;rsquo;ve had with jævla søringa.
So many people from Oslo consider Trondheim as the first city of northern norway. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense at all. I am currently, in late september basking in the southern sun beaming upon my forehead. Do you ever feel self counscious about the size or shape of your forehead?
Me neither.</description></item><item><title>On starving</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/starving/</guid><description>811 million people. 10% of everyone on this planet go hungry regularly. Thats fucking nuts, man.
I usually end up starving because of my own stupidity.
I am my own worst enemy.
Sundays. Sundays are my &amp;ldquo;starving days&amp;rdquo;
Usually i wake up feeling as one should feel on a lovely sunday morning.
Super mega ultra hungover.
I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna lie. I should probably maybe drink less.
Sometimes when i wake up, i catch myself wondering: Am i ever going to feel hydrated again?</description></item><item><title>Rød</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/roed/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/roed/</guid><description>Todays blogpost is special, but only because it&amp;rsquo;s not special AT ALL. Todays topic is so impressively, and UTTERLY un-interesting.
It&amp;rsquo;s the first color of the rainbow, from the top down.
The colour of blood, hell, and pain.
But simultaniously also the colour of love.
Ah, the duality of red!
The colour of leftist politics in europe, but then across the pond red is associated with the republicans.
It&amp;rsquo;s ironic how communists and MAGA lunatics have this strong colour in common.</description></item><item><title>Kirkegata 61a experience</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/kirkegata-61a-experience/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/kirkegata-61a-experience/</guid><description>Kirkegata 61a experience. Omgivelse + cast Når man synker ned i kjelleren, forbi den råtne mugghula som har varmtvannstanken vår, glemme man fort at det e sol ute. I kjellern e det alltid mørkt. I kjellern blir man truffet av en vegg med egglukt, da hele kollektivet spiser hovedsakelig stekte egg, til hvert eneste måltid. Veggene har samme gulfarge som en hvit tskjorte som har blitt svetta og smurt med solkrem.</description></item><item><title>HELLO WORLD</title><link>https://nuutti.no/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>My first post This website is my digital canvas.
However, i will not be doing any art, or painting for that matter! (well, perhaps?) I will be spewing my thoughts, into the void, for the world wide web to see. There will be (un)funny stories, how to&amp;rsquo;s, and whatever else comes out of my brain. Completely unprocessed and raw.
I will be vomiting ideas onto this digital canvas.
Spraying my non-intellectual diarrhea into this cesspool we call the internet.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/gallery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/gallery/</guid><description>Photo gallery Test picture</description></item><item><title/><link>https://nuutti.no/lore/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nuutti.no/lore/</guid><description>what is going on? i am human. i need no introduction.
This is a blog. I made this website with some (a huge amount of) help from my roommate Isak.
If the website is poorly made, it is simply because i do not know how to program a website at all. Consider this a practical example of a monkey on a typewriter
The words written here, hatch from my under-developed frontal lobe.</description></item></channel></rss>
